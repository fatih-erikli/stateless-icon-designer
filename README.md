# What does Stateless mean?
Stateless means the state of the application stored on the URL part of the application. It is a web application architecture defines the application as a framework and the access URI of the application as content.

# What are the advantages of it?
- The content is undoable and redoable by design
- The current state of document is bookmarkable
- The application state is visible for user
- The content can be updated in URL
- It does not need require a user authentication to share the content

# Who are you?
I am a software engineer with 10+ years of web development and design experience. I am an open-source lover and I create development productivity tools in my spare time. I am much more focused on accessibility and health tech in my last years engineering experience; I experiment to create an accessible, crystal-clear, discoverable user interfaces for the end users.

# Follow me but don't get me wrong
When I post something on a social media, please think the post is not only about the content itself, but the process of posting the content from the very beginning (the keypress events on my keyboard) to the very end (the end user which is you, assigned with an IPv4 or IPv6 address; probably there are at least 10 dynamic routers between us). I do experimenting on web technologies and I need to post something and I usually write something super random depending on my mood; including my blog posts and articles.
